# onitra
<p>The last IDE that you gonna learn</p>


<h4>What it is?</h4>

Onitra brings defaults set ups for transform your vim into an IDE with all power of VIM.
The objective is :

<ul>
    <li>Select plugins for enhance the work;</li>
    <li>Turn easy the curve of learning Vim. Will not be necessary searching and learning how to use VIM as a IDE;</li>
    <li>A same IDE through every OS working and that work  through  the terminal, so you can connect from SSH and work normally;</li>
    <li>In my career I used to work with many others IDEs like  IntelliJ IDEA, Zend Studio, Eclipse, Netbeans... But I always had issues like licence, speed, colors, plugins. Onitra solve those problems gathering tested great plugins available on github.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why VIM?</h4>

As a developers, we always think about this question "What IDE must I choose? ", "Vim, Emacs or Nano?". I really like Emacs, but I rather Vim for this project because:
<ol>
    <li>Vim is standard in many OS;</li>
    <li>Vim Interface is notable, it have another idea and is light;</li>
    <li>Vim have (in my opinion) a better community support.</li>
</ol>

The version is VIM8, only because more people are using it. But fell free to use others versions.


<h4>Installation</h4>

You must have the vim installed in your system.

<ol>
    <li>Install vim-plug. Every thing that will be installed will be with this plugin Check https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug and install in your vim;</li>
    <li>
        Put the content of default.vimrc in your .vimrc or replace the file. Attention! Check if your .vimrc file exist!
        Now you must choose your configuration for example <br/>
        <p>
            call plug#begin()<br/>
            source ~/.vim/onitra.vim<br/>
            source ~/.vim/onitra_web_php.vim<br/>
            call plug#end()<br/>
        </p>
        Here I choose the web php script, that set php, html, less, javascript configurations.
    </li>
    <li>Put the noitra files inside you .vim/ folder;</li>
    <li>Open vim, avoid the initial erros notices, type :PlugInstall and wait the *instalation;</li>
    <li>Edit you .vimrc and uncommit the line with this content "#source ~/.vim/onitra.vim". Attention! if you are using vim on windows, would be necessary change the file path;</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>



This is the first commit of Onitra. The documentation Will be release soon.
